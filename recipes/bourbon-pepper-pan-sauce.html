    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mastering pan sauces is one of the most important but easiest steps towards producing legit restaurant-quality
        dishes at home. Assemble all the sauce ingredients before cooking the steak so you can make the sauce during the
        5-minute resting time for steak. The rich, sweet, peppery flavor profile also works wonderfully with pork chops
        and grilled chicken. You can also switch up the bourbon for another liquor, since this really is just a
        technique recipe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) New York strip steaks</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons duck fat, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 fluid ounce bourbon</li>
        <li>Â½ cup chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season both sides of the steaks generously with salt and pepper. Be especially generous with the pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Melt duck fat in a steel pan over medium-high heat. Add steaks; cook until firm and reddish-pink in the
            center for medium-rare, about 5 minutes per side. Sear the edges until browned, about 30 seconds each.
            Transfer steaks to a plate; let rest while you make the sauce. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Stir garlic into the same pan using a spoon. Add 1 teaspoon butter; let melt. Pour in bourbon. Heat until
            reduced to a sticky glaze, about 15 seconds. Add chicken stock. Bring to a boil over high heat while
            scraping up the browned bits at the bottom to deglaze. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add
            heavy cream; season with salt and cayenne pepper. Boil until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and add remaining 2 teaspoons butter; swirl until melted, about 30 seconds more. Spoon sauce
            warm onto serving plates. Place steaks on top.</li>
    </ol>
